This project provides an effective, automated solution for attendance management and secure access control, leveraging the capabilities of an Arduino microcontroller, RFID technology, and a servo motor. The system is designed to automate the tracking of individuals’ attendance by using RFID tags or cards, each assigned with unique identification data. When a tag is scanned, the system captures critical information—such as the individual’s name, roll number, and the exact time of entry—and stores it in an Excel sheet, ensuring reliable and easy-to-access records. The system incorporates a brief time delay after each scan, allowing for secure data logging and helping to prevent duplicate entries.

A key feature of this system is its ability to control access with a servo motor, which is activated to unlock the door only after an individual’s attendance has been successfully recorded. This integration of attendance tracking and access control provides an additional layer of security, ensuring that only registered individuals can enter restricted areas. This functionality is particularly valuable in environments where monitoring attendance and controlling access are essential, such as in classrooms, offices, or secured facilities. By automating both attendance recording and entry authorization, the system minimizes manual oversight, reduces the potential for errors, and enhances overall security.

This system's scalability and flexibility make it adaptable to various organizational needs. Built with cost-effective components like the Arduino Uno, RC522 RFID reader, and a simple servo motor, it provides a reliable and budget-friendly solution that can be easily deployed and maintained. The RFID technology ensures quick identification, while the Arduino’s versatile control over input-output operations enables seamless interaction with both the RFID reader and the servo motor. The use of Excel for attendance record storage further simplifies data management, making it easy to track, retrieve, and analyze attendance data as needed.

In summary, this project demonstrates how combining automation with secure access control can provide a comprehensive, efficient solution for attendance management. It not only saves time and resources by automating routine tasks but also contributes to security by restricting access to authorized individuals. With its versatility and efficiency, this system offers a valuable application of technology for any setting where attendance and controlled access are a priority.
